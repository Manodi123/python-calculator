Code Explanation
Imports:

tkinter for the GUI elements.
math for advanced mathematical operations.
Main Window Configuration:

The window is created and configured with a specific title, size, and background color.
Global Variables:

equation: Holds the current input or result.
history: Stores the last five calculations.
Functions:

show(value): Appends a character to the equation and updates the display.
clear(): Clears the current equation.
clear_last_entry(): Removes the last character from the equation.
calculate(): Evaluates the equation and handles errors.
show_history(): Displays the history of calculations in a new window.
